This repository contains 2 programms labeled as "eshop_server" and "client" where one accomodates a server's code and the other a client's code respectfully. These 2 programms create a simulation of an eshop enviroment using sockets. Firstly, the server initializes the rand() seed and the catalog struct, then waits for a client. When that happens, the client generates a random number indicating which product number he would like to purchase and that number is sent to the server. The server processes the order, if the product is available it updates the client's total and the same process starts again. At the end of the client's final offer, if all of his products are available he is shown his final cost with the appropriate message. On the other hand, if at least one product is unavailable he encounters an error. When all client's are serviced, the server shows: 1) the total orders 2) total successful orders 3) total failed orders 4) total profit 5) how many products were requested 6) how many products were bought 7) total amount of orders 8) how many requests were made 9) how many requests succeeded 10) how many requests failed.
